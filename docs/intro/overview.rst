Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have received widespread attention
and have significantly improved performance on audio tasks such as conversation,
audio understanding, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Despite these
advancements, there is an absence of a benchmark for assessing AudioLLMs in
financial scenarios, where audio data, such as earnings conference calls and CEO
speeches, are crucial resources for financial analysis and investment decisions.
In this paper, we introduce FINAUDIO, the first benchmark designed to evaluate
the capacity of AudioLLMs in the financial domain. We first define three tasks
based on the unique characteristics of the financial domain: 1. ASR for short
financial audio, 2. ASR for long financial audio, and 3. summarization of long
financial audio. Then, we curate two short and two long audio datasets, respectively,
and develop a novel dataset for financial audio summarization, comprising the
FINAUDIO benchmark. We evaluate seven prevalent AudioLLMs on FINAUDIO.
Our evaluation reveals the limitations of existing AudioLLMs in the financial
domain and offers insights for improving AudioLLM
